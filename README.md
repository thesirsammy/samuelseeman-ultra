# Samuel Seeman's Personal Site

The source code for my personal website, found at [samseeman.com](https://samseeman.com).

Designed completely from scratch, using only the elements below. This is my first home-base site designed without any templates using modern, adaptable frameworks.

Uses:
- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **[Motion-Primitives](https://motion-primitives.com/)**

To try for yourself (not sure why you'd want to, but whatever):
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/thesirsammy/samuelseeman-ultra.git` to download a copy of the site
2. `cd samuelseeman-ultra`
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm run dev` to initialize a dev server
