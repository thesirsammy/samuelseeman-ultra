        <p>Hey there! I&apos;m Sam Seeman, a student at the University of Alabama studying Computer Engineering. 
        I&apos;m originally from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.</p> <br />
        <div className="flex md:flex-nowrap flex-wrap gap-6 md:items-center md:justify-between justify-center">
          <p className="">I started my online journey at the age of 14 when I launched
            <a href="https://savvytechsupport.com" target="_blank" className="text-accent hover:text-accent-hover duration-200"> SavvyTech Support</a>, a small tech support service. At the time, all I wanted was to have my own business with a fancy 
            new domain all to myself. Little did I know that this seemingly small task would launch me down the rabbit hole of Wordpress, HTML, self-hosting, and eventually into the world of computer science. From that one little idea grew a passion
            for so much more.</p>

        </div>
        <br /><p>This first experience of many inspired me to love learning for its own sakeâ€“I discovered that I had interests 
          and passions I cared about, not just ones that were thrown at me in school. That introduction with programming got me hooked, and
          eventually ended up in my pursuit of a Computer Engineering degree.</p>

        <p>Outside of the classroom and coding, I follow a wide variety of activities such as theater, graphic design, 
          politics, paddleboarding, and photography. I think this range of interests reflects the fact that always I try to be a 
          well-rounded person, pursuing many different areas of interest at once.
